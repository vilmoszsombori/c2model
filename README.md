# Steady-state heat conduction on triangulated planar domains

Developed by us, __Bálint Miklós__ and __Vilmos Zsombori__, while we were students at the __Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania__ in May, 2002. We wrote a small report on this (in Hungarian) that we submitted for the _Műszaki Tudományos Diákkonferencia (TDK)_ student conference in Timișoara, Romania in 2002.  

### Abstract

We give theoretical tools, object oriented design and Java implementation for the two dimensional steady-state heat conduction problem applying the finite element method. NURB curves are used to describe the domain of definition. A non-uniform, shape and size guaranteed triangulation is generated using the Delaunay refinement algorithm. For the spatial discretization of the function space we use linear Spline basis functions, and then we compute a set of scalars to determine the function which gives the best approximation of the solvence on our space.
